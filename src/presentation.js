              Discuss modal editing in brief (its vim conf so don't need to sell
              this too hard). However vim has classically been bound to the
              terminal although with the advent of neovim which can be embedded
              inside other programs

            But Oni does more than that. Oni allows Neovim to have features of
            an IDE such as integration with language servers, more advanced

              Its now possible to create an IDE with neovim at its core that
              provides the power and speed of modal editing combined with the
              nicieites and utilties of a GUI IDE.{" "}

              A key difference between Oni and alternatives like vscode or
              sublime with a vim plugin is that at its core Oni is just vim,
              that means it uses your vim config with all your carefully crafted
              mappings and scripts and you can use all of your plugins as normal

            Oni - aims to expand on the core vim experience by providing
            additional features and an enhanced GUI we try to ensure that as
            many features as possible can be toggled or configured.

            This isn't to say that we purposely exclude any users however there
            are likely vim users who rely on vim's minimalism and portablility
            and a such having to download an app with a gui shell will not
            provide the right experience.

            The aim is also to lessen the amount of time and effort that goes
            into setting up vim (or at least of the visual aspects of setting up
            vim). We see oni as being a good choice for vim users who want the
            features of an IDE, or for new users who are curious about trying a
            fully fledged modal editor

            Performance has always been one of the major advantages of using
