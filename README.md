# Oni: The Gui-fication of Neovim

This repo contains the slides for my VimConf18 talk called `the gui-fication of neovim`.
It's written using `Formidable`'s spectacle because why not :laughing:, coding your slides is fun.
If you have any suggestions and are fan or contributor to `Oni` let me know your thoughts
the content of the slides is in `presentation.js`

You can see the presentation by `git clone`-ing the repository and running `yarn start` or `npm start`
